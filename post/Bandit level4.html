                        <p>Using command to get the password which is stored in a hidden file in the 'inhere' directory</p>

                            <!-- In this level we need to find a hidden file in the 'inhere' directory. First, we use 'ls' to see if there has any file to be used.
                            After command 'ls', a directory called inhere showed up. Therefore, we use 'cd inhere' to entry the directory.
                            In the 'inhere' directory, we used 'ls' again. However, there didn't have any file. After checking the goal, I noticed the word 'hidden file'.
                            As a result, I used the command 'ls -l', 'l'. The former one' output is 'total 0'. The later one output nothing.
                            After this strange thing happend, I was wondering if there's could be anything wrong. So I consulted to the man page, to my surprised, I found a parameter which can show the hidden file.
                            That's '-a'. Therfore, I used it immidiately. After typing in 'ls -a', we find the hidden file called '.hidden'.
                            Finding the file means finding the key. As the file showed up, the key can be easily got by the command 'cat .hidden'. -->
                            
                            In this level, we need to find a hidden file in the 'inhere' directory. First, we use 'ls' to see if there are any files to be used. 
                            After the 'ls' command, a directory called 'inhere' showed up. Therefore, we use 'cd inhere' to enter the directory. 
                            In the 'inhere' directory, we used 'ls' again. However, there didn't appear to be any files. After checking the goal, I noticed the term 'hidden file'. 
                            As a result, I used the command 'ls -l' or 'll'. The former one's output is 'total 0'. The latter one outputs nothing. 
                            When this unusual occurrence happened, I wondered if there could be anything wrong. So I consulted the man page and, to my surprise, I found a parameter that can show hidden files, which is '-a'. 
                            Therefore, I used it immediately. After typing 'ls -a', we found the hidden file called '.hidden'. Finding the file means finding the key. 
                            As the file showed up, the key can be easily obtained using the command 'cat .hidden'.

                            <!-- However, when I got the key and want to use this new parameter agian, I mistyped 'ls' to 'll'. To my surprised, system didn't show error, but demonstrating us the hidden files and the details of it.
                            I was really surprised to this consequence. So I started search on the Internet, some people say that alias ll = ls -l, which might be correct in different setting and environment.
                            But in my solving process, we can see that when using 'ls -l' system' response is 'total 0'. However, while using 'll', system give all the details and hidden files.
                            In my opinion, the correct way to equivilant 'll' is the command parameter:'-al'. It can not only show the details but show the hidden files, which functionally work same with 'll'. -->

                            However, in my solving process, we can see that when using 'ls -l', the system's response is 'total 0'. On the other hand, when using 'll', the system displays all the details and hidden files. In my opinion, the correct equivalent of 'll' is the command parameter '-al'. 
                            It can not only show the details but also display the hidden files, whose functionality is exactly the same as 'll'.
