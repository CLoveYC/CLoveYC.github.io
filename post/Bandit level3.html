                                This level is similar to the previous level. But in this case, what we need to solve is the space problem.
                                When typing command like 'cat spaces in this filename', system will consider it as four respective files. So, there must be a way to let system know that the space is an element included in it.
                                As soon as the problem arise, the escape character immediately came into my mind. As a result, I give it a try 'cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename'.
                                Then system gave me the key. But I started wondering, is there another solution? After thinking for a while, I noticed that I can use double quotation mark.
                                By the help of double quotation mark, the system theoretical consider "spaces in this filename" as a single file, which can help us solve this problem.
                                Therefore, I gave it a try and successfully got the key. In my opinion, I think both of solutions is great.
                                Althouugh having spaces in the filename might not be a good filename, but when facing these kind of file, both of these can efficenly help.

                            This level is similar to the previous one. However, in this case, the challenge involves dealing with spaces in filenames. 
                            When typing a command like 'cat spaces in this filename', the system will interpret it as four separate files. Therefore, there must be a way to let the system know that the space is part of the filename. 
                            As soon as the problem arose, the escape character immediately came to mind. Consequently, I tried 'cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename', and the system provided me with the key. 
                            However, I began to wonder if there was another solution. After some thought, I realized that I could use double quotation marks. By enclosing the filename in double quotation marks, the system theoretically considers "spaces in this filename" as a single file, which can help solve this problem. 
                            Therefore, I tried it and successfully obtained the key. In my opinion, both solutions are excellent. 
                            Although having spaces in filenames might not be ideal, when faced with such files, both of these methods can efficiently help.
